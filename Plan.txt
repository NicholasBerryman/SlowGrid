
SlowGrid plan:
	- Make 'SlowGrid Benchmarks' Project
		- Executable, not library
		- For now just benchmark:
			- 'new' vs Arena.alloc()
			- LocalDataStructure::Queue vs std::Queue vs Allocator::CachedQueue
			- LocalDataStructures::Stack vs std::Stack
			- LocalDataStructure::Dequeue vs std::Dequeue
			- Allocator::ULL vs std::Vector
		- General test ideas:
			- On small amounts of small data
			- On small amounts of large data (e.g. structs of non-heap arrays)
			- On large amounts of small data
			- On large amounts of large data
		- Compiler optimisation:
			- Run in o3 mode
			- Force inclusion of benchmarking code -> Don't let it get optimised out of compilation
			- Consider Google Benchmarking library:
				- Should also be able to take into account things like 'branch prediction learning a pattern'
	
	- Add Pathfinding
		- Maps -> Alogrithms -> add to benchmarks
	
	- Add Spatial Queries
		- Trees -> add to benchmarks

	- Add Gameloop
		- Timer sub-module:
			- Don't use Chrono except as fallback -> Warn if this happens
			- Windows -> QueryPerformanceCounter(), QueryPerformanceFrequency()
			- Linux   -> clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC), clock_getres(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
			- GBA     -> REG_TMxD (x=[0,1,2])
		- No FLECS interface yet
	
	- Add Input system
		- Raylib -> input queue
		- Add recordable input macros (new module -> depends on Input and Gameloop)
	
	- Add FLECS interface

	- Github Action output compiled binaries?? artifacts???

	- Add cross-compilation???
		- Linux/Windows -> DevkitArm
			- Separate parameters for: NX, (3DS), (DS), GBA
